# FlowerClassification
This repo is about the flower classification using machine learning and image processing techniques.
It basically involves flower resizing,flower segmentation using chan-vese algorithm then extracting texture based features and color moments.
These features are fed into the KNN for the classification of flowers.
There are four dataset of flowers daffodils,lotus,daisy and bluebell following are there images respectively.

Their  training images are included in folder 1,2,3 and 4.
The test images are also included in the flower testing images folder.
Give your own directory in the code to execute the code.
This model can be furthur enhanced as well by using your own dataset of data flowers
